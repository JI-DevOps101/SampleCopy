# SampleCopy
This is my first trial of creating files on my first repository.
The practice would involve trying out the following:
  - Actually creating the file named SampleCopy
  - Writing desriptions of the file
  - attaching an image to file
  - committing changes as i go along
  - preview the readme 
  - exploring deleting the whole repository when am done
